# Helping Hands

## An app that bridges the gap between deaf job seekers and inclusive employers.

Helping Hands is a mobile app designed to make the job search process more accessible and inclusive for deaf individuals. It empowers deaf job seekers to connect with employers who value their skills and contributions, and it equips employers with the tools to create a more welcoming and accessible workplace for all.

Built with Passion at GDSC Hackfest 2024!

This app is not just a product, it's a testament to the innovative spirit and dedication of the team at GDSC Hackfest 2024. We came together with a shared vision of creating a more inclusive future for deaf individuals, and poured our hearts and minds into making Helping Hands a reality.
